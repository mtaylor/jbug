= Face Blog - Models and Validation

Now that you have everything installed, you're ready to rock n roll.  It's time to create your first rails application.  You're going to create a new social networking site called Face Blog.

== Creating a Rails App

- cd into the src/1 directory.  We'll work from here.

First thing you need to do is create a new rails application.  Well that's pretty easy.

  rails new face_blog

Notice the file structure.  Every rails app looks the same.  This makes it easy to quickly get involved in other rails projects, since you already know your way around.

The main areas you'll be working in today are:

  app/       # This cContains all your MVC files
  config/    # Used to configure your app
  db/        # Where migrations and schema lives

== Adding gems

First thing we're going to add to our site is a User.  We want to allow the user to login, signup and all that jazz.  But of course we're not going to write all that ourselves.  We'll use a library to do the grunt work for us.

We're going to add "devise" (an authentication mechanism for rails) to our application, as well as a few extra libraries that we'll need later.

All the libraries your application dependes on are specified in your applicatons Gemfile (found in your applicaitons root directory).  Let's add in devise and a couple of other dependencies such as a javascript runtime, openssl and jdbc adapter sqlite3.

Open up your applications Gemfile and add the following under where is says: gem "rails", "3.2.x"

  gem 'devise'
  gem 'execjs'
  gem 'therubyrhino'
  gem 'jruby-openssl'
  gem 'activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter'

Notice the convention here.  The gem name is on the left followed by the version.  You can set up multiple environments in rails.  Such as development, prodcution, test.  You can specify gems for just one environment.  For example you might want to add postgres libraries for production, but for development we want to use 'sqlite3'

Now run bundler to pull in the dependecies into our gemset.  (Make sure you're in your applicaion root directory)

  bundle install

Note: a gemset is a feature of rvm.  It allows us to create a groups of gems that are encapsulated to prevent conflicts.


Devise is a rails engine (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html), don't worry about what engines are right now, we just need to know that we need to do some setup that is specific to devise.  From you're terminal run the following (from you're applicaiton root directory)

  rails generate devise:install
  rails generate devise:views


== Testing our app

Before we continue, let's make sure we have the correct dependencies and that we can deploy our rails app on TorqueBox.  Start TorqueBox and deploy your applicaton.  If all goes well you should be able to see the rails landing page.  For information on how to start TorqueBox and to deploy your app check out section 2. Running TorqueBox.  Be sure to return here when your done.

== Rails Console

For the next section we won't be needing to test things in TorqueBox, we'll use the rails console.  The rails console is a ruby irb (Itegrated Ruby Shell) with your full rails application enviornment loaded.  It's ideal for testing models, validation and just for trying things out.  To start the rails console type:

  rails c # from you applicaton root directory

You can now issue ruby commands.  Just try: 

  1 + 1

If you make changes to your model, database, controllers etc... You'll need to reload the enviroment.  To do that issue the reload! command:

  reload!

To close the rails console type:

  quit

== Models and Migrations

So we started off by saying we were going to add a user.  Let's get to the chace.

To create our user model and migration we'll use a model generator.  We don't always have to stick to the generators that come with rails.  3rd party libraries can also offer generators.  To see which generators you have avaiable to you.  You can run

  rails generate

To create our user model we'll use the devise model generator.

  rails generate devise User name:string dob:date

Note: A rails migration is used to make changes to your database.  If you look at the migration that devise created (under db/migrate) you can see that devise created a new table and added some information such as email, password + the fields we specified (name and dob) devise uses this information to perform a range of authentication.  

Migrations are timestamped and ran in order.  So you can create a database then add an extra field later if you so wish.  Anyone else using your app simply runs the migrations and just that extra field is added.

So, now that we've added some migrations we'll create the applications databases and migrate.

  rake db:create:all # Creates databases for test, production, development
  rake db:migrate    # Migrates the current rails env database: development

Next thing we need to do is make the our dob and name attributes pubic (This is so we can mass-assign them later in our controller).  We do this by setting the attr_accessible method offered by ActiveRecord::Base.  Open up the model app/models/user.rb and add in :name and :dob to the attr_accessible method:

  attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me, :name, :dob

== Validations

You can now test out your model in the rails console.

  rails c

You can exit the rails console at any point by issueing a quit command:

  quit

Lets create a new user from the rails console.

  me = User.new(:name => "Martyn", :dob => "11/22/1984")

What happens when you try to save me

  me.save!

You should have receive a validation exception.  This happens because devise has added in some extra validation to our model.  We must enter an email, password, password_confirmation when creating a new user.  Let's try again.


  me = User.new(:name => "Martyn", :dob => "11/22/1984", :email => "mtaylor@redhat.com", :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password")
  me.save!

Voila it works.  Congratulations you've just created your first rails model :D

==== NOTE: 

Through out this practical your going to create many users.  Devise has a uniqueness validation on email address.  If you get complaints from Devise, you can delete conflicting users.  To delete just call the destroy method on the user; you can delete all users using the command below:

  # Delete a single user
  me.destroy

  # Delete All Users
  User.all.each { |u| u.destroy }

Now we've seen devise validations in action, its time to add our own.  Face Blog is for over 18s only and user must supply a name.  Let's start by adding validation to make sure name is not empty.  Open up the user model, add in name validation.

  validates :name, :presence => true, :length => { :minimum => 2 }

This makes sure that a user supplies a name and its length greater than or equal to 2

Now time for checking the age.  We could use the rails helper methods for checking the age.  But instead we're going to create a custom method to stop underage users signing up.

  validates :dob, :presence => true
  validate :must_be_an_adult

  def must_be_an_adult
    if (Time.now - 18.years) < dob
      errors.add(:age, "must be over 18")
    end
  end

Reload open up a new rails console "rails c" or run reload! (This reloads your environement) from your existing IRB session:

Try it out to see if its working.

  User.create!(:email => "mtaylor@redhat.com", :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password", :dob => "01/01/2010", :name => "")

You should receive another validation exception informing us that the name cannot be blank and the users age must be over 18.

== Associations

Now that you've grasped validations it's time to move on to associations.  Associations in rails are simply relationships between models.

Face Blog allows users to add friends.  To do this wel'll need an extra model, we'll call it friendship.  This will be used to store mappings between users.  We'll setup model assoications to acheive the ERD show below:

link:images/first_model_erd.png

To start we need to create the extra friendship model.  We'll use a generator to do this, run the following from your terminal in your application root directory:

  rails generate model Friendship user_id:integer friend_id:string
  rake db:migrate

Note the naming convention here.  When we setup associations in rails, ActiveRecord automatically looks for a foreign key named <association_name>_id.  It's possible to override this, but we'll stick to convention for now to make it easy.

Next we need to add in the association into the models.

In the friendship model we add two associations

  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :friend, :class_name => "User"

these associations link up the two ids we store to User objects.  For each friendship we can now get the User (the owner of the friendship) and the Friend (Another User).

Now lets do the same on the User side.

  has_many :friendships
  has_many :friends, :through => :friendships

The last association is more of a convenience method.  Really we want to deal with friends not with friendships, ActiveRecord will look at the friendship Model for an association called :friend which we defined previously, and retreive the User with that ID.

Now time to test it all out.  Reload your rails environment again: 'reload!' and create some users and friendships.

  # Delete all users (To prevent any conflicts)
  User.all.each { |u| u.destroy }

  # User 1
  martyn = User.create!(:email => "mtaylor@redhat.com", :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password", :name => "martyn", :dob => "11/22/1984")

  # User 2
  dave = User.create!(:email => "dave@redhat.com", :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password", :name => "Dave", :dob => "01/01/1950")

  # Add dave as a friend
  martyn.friends << dave
  martyn.save!

  # Check the relation
  martyn.friends

You might have noticed that dave still has no friends.  This is becuase we only set up the association in one direction.  We could add the inverse assoications to the user model, which would solve this issue.  But for the sake of simplicity we'll simply add an extra friendship entry.

  # Add Martyn as Daves friend
  dave.friends << martyn
  dave.save!  
  
=== Overview

There you have it.  You've successfully managed to create new models, migrations add validation and setup associations.  All in the space of a few minutes.  Next we'll start building up the Controller and View side of our applicaton.  We're going to need a ruby server running to test this.  If you haven't already, check out the Running TorqueBox section.  If your having trouble with TorqueBox don't worry you can just use the default ruby server for testing purposes.  To start it:

  rails s
